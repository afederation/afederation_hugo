I live in Seattle, WA where I'm a fellow studying bioinformatics, epigenomics and proteomics at the [Altius Institute for Biomedical Research](http://altius.org) with my supervisors John Stamatoyannopoulos and Mike MacCoss. I'm interested in drugs and other molecules that alter the regulation of the human genome. As gene regulation is a highly complex and dynamic process, I combine tools from several fields to study these molecules including chemical biology, genome editing, systems-wide measurements and analytical techniques that can handle the large datasets that we generate.

With the goal to always continue learning, I'm currently working on projects to help me learn common machine learning approaches and other cool algorithms and how they might be useful in my biology. I hope to share my experiences here.

Outside of the lab I try to get into the mountains to climb and run as much as I can. I also volunteer with [King County Search and Rescue](https://www.kcesar.org/) to help others having a bad day in the mountains.
