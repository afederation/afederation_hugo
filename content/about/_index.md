I live in Seattle, WA where I'm a research fellow studying bioinformatics, epigenomics and proteomics at the [Altius Institute for Biomedical Research](http://altius.org) with my supervisors John Stamatoyannopoulos and Mike MacCoss. I'm interested in understanding the networks regulating the human genome and how we can use molecules as tools to manipulate these networks. Gene regulation is a highly complex and dynamic process, so we need tools from several fields to study these molecules including chemical biology, genome engineering, systems-wide assays and computational techniques to handle the large datasets that we generate.

Lately, I've been working on projects to learn machine learning and other cool computational approaches being developed and how they might be useful to study biology. I hope to share some of my experiences with these tools here.

Outside of the lab I try to get into the mountains to climb and run as much as I can. I also volunteer with [King County Search and Rescue](https://www.kcesar.org/) to help others having a bad day in the mountains.
