I live in Seattle, WA where I'm a research fellow studying bioinformatics, epigenomics and proteomics at the [Altius Institute for Biomedical Research](http://altius.org) with my supervisors John Stamatoyannopoulos and Mike MacCoss. I'm interested in understanding the networks that regulate the human genome using computational models and drug-like compounds to manipulate these networks. Gene regulation is a highly complex and dynamic process, my work draws from several fields including data science, chemical biology, genome engineering and high-throughput genomics / proteomics.

Lately, I've been working on small projects to learn machine learning and how they might be useful to study biology. I hope to share some of my experiences with these tools here.

Outside of the lab I try to get into the mountains to climb and run as much as I can. I also volunteer with [King County Search and Rescue](https://www.kcesar.org/) to help people having a bad day in the mountains.
